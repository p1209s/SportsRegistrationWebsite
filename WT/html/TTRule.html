    <h1>Table Tennis Rules and Regulation</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Basic Rules:</li></h3>
        <ul>
           <li>The aim of the game is simple; hit the ball over the net onto your opponent’s side. A point is won by you if your opponent
              is unable to return the ball to your side of the table (e.g. they miss the ball, they hit the ball but it misses your side of the table,
              or the ball hits the net), or if they hit the ball before it bounces on their side of the table.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3><li>Scoring:</li></h3>
         <ul>
            <li>The winner of a game is the first to 11 points. There must be a gap of at least two points between opponents at the end of the 
                 game though, so if the score is 10-10, the game goes in to extra play until one of the players has gained a lead of 2 points.
                 The point goes to the player who successfully ends a rally, regardless of who has served.</li>
            <li>A match can consist of the number of games you like, just make sure you agree this in advance!</li>
         </ul><br>
        <h3><li>Serving:</li></h3>
          <ul>
             <li>A player takes two serves before the ball switches to the opponent to serve, except during periods of extra play where it changes each time.
                  The first person to serve at the start of the game can be determined in many different ways, we’ll leave that up to you to decide! Service can 
                  be diagonal or in a straight line in singles</li>
          </ul><br>
        <h3><li>Service rule you must obey:</li></h3>
           <ul>
             <li>The ball must first bounce on your side and then in your opponents. Your opponent must allow the ball to hit their side of the table before trying to return this.</li>
             <li>The ball must pass cleanly over the net – if it ‘clips’ the net and goes over, it is a ‘let’ and the serve is retaken. If it hits the net and doesn’t go over,
                  the point goes to the other player/team. There are no second serves.</li>
           </ul>
    </ol>
